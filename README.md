# Solar Power Prediction in Denmark
This project focuses on developing a predictive algorithm to accurately forecast the electricity production from solar cells in Denmark. Given the variability of solar power output influenced by weather conditions, such as cloud cover, our goal is to enhance grid management for EnergiNet, the national grid operator. By predicting solar power production with greater accuracy, we aim to facilitate more efficient and safer grid operations, ultimately reducing maintenance costs and ensuring grid stability.

## Features
- **Mathematical Modelling**: Utilizes mathematical models to address the challenges of predicting solar power output.
- **Data Analysis**: Employs satellite imagery from the Meteosat programme and production data from EnergiNet to analyze and predict solar power production.
- **Regularized Regression**: Incorporates regularized regression techniques to manage the challenges posed by high-dimensional data.
- **Algorithm Development**: Features the development of a transparent, interpretable prediction algorithm that does not rely on "black box" models.

## Data
The project leverages High Rate SEVIRI Level 1.5 Image Data from the Meteosat satellites and electricity production data from EnergiNet. The satellite data provides comprehensive imagery every 15 minutes, which, along with production data, forms the basis for predictive modeling.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**
- **Satellite Imagery and Production Data** Utilizes satellite images and real-world production data to predict solar power output.
- **Regression Models** Explores the use of regularized regression to predict power production from the available data.
